                            have embarked on a journey of a musical documentary film of the Gandharva village located in
                            Kechana,
                            Jhapa, Indian Border. <br><br>

                            The story of the musical community's quest to build a tiny museum - to establish their
                            pastoral cultural
                            essence and advocate cultural dignity. The battalion of minstrels on a relentless journey
                            from village
                            to
                            village/ public administration to political authorities to build a museum. <br><br>

                            We intend to film the entire journey through different landscapes and travel with them to
                            complete this
                            documentary film and find the answers of their motivation, inspiration, and intention.
